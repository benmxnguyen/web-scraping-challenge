# web-scraping-challenge

This assignment allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of Python, MongoDB, and Web Development. By leveraging all of these technologies, I was able to build an application that web scraped data on Mars, inserted the scraped data into a database, and outputed the data to some webpage in a presentable format.

About the data: All of the scraped data came from webpages on information regarding Mars, some of which were dynamic.

I had to leverage the power of BeautifulSoup and Splinter in order to automate the process of web scraping the html. I also used flask_pymongo in order to connect and query the database from within python.
